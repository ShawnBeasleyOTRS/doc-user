   | Ticket | Date / Time | ``TicketCalendarEndTime``   | Calendar End Time   |
   +--------+-------------+-----------------------------+---------------------+

2. Navigate to *Frontend* → *Agent* → *View* and select a view to add the dynamic field to.

   For example add these dynamic fields to *New Phone Ticket* screen and *New Email Ticket* screen to set the dates at ticket creation time, or to *Ticket Free Fields* screen to set the dates for existing ticket in the *Miscellaneous* → *Free Fields* menu item of the :doc:`../tickets/ticket-zoom` screen.
