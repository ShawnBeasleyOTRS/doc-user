Chat Widget
-----------

The chat widget is the main component when chatting with other people. It provides a history of all messages in the chat as well as list of possible actions depending on your permission level.

The messages can be sent using the text field of a chat in *My Active Chats* widget by either clicking the send icon next to the text field or hitting the Enter key. Shift + Enter can be used to insert a new line into the message.

Every chat participant has a colored circle icon before his/her name in the chat widget header, which represents the participant availability.

- Green: participant is active (available and online).
- Yellow: participant is away (available, but there was no request sent to the server from this user for some time set in ``ChatEngine::AgentOnlineThreshold``).
- Pink: participant is inactive (chat request is not accepted yet or participant left the chat).
- Red: participant is unavailable (set via availability button).
- Black: participant has logged out or session has expired.

The chat widget has some icons in the top right corner.

.. figure:: images/chat-menu.png
   :alt: Chat Menu

   Chat Menu

The first triangle icon expands and collapses the chat menu. The menu has several menu items.

Phone ticket
   Allows you to create a phone ticket to which the current chat will be appended to as an article. After the ticket has successfully created, the chat will get closed automatically.

Append
   Allows you to append this chat as an article to a selected ticket. After the article has been created, the chat will get closed automatically.

Invite
   Allows you to invite another agent to this chat. You can select from a list of available agents who you want to invite. Once the agent has invited, a new agent to agent chat request will be sent to this agent. After the request has accepted, a new internal chat will be established between you and the invited agent. In this internal chat, the invited agent has two more actions available in the advanced actions toolbar: *Observer* and *Participant*.

Channel change
   Using this link, you can change the channel for this chat. For the selection of the target channel the same rules apply as for initially selecting a chat channel.

Download
   Lets you download the complete history of this chat as PDF.

New window
   Opens this chat in a separate popup window. You can use this window in the same way as the chat widget and both the widget and the popup can be used at the same time.

Observer
   When you have been invited to a chat by another agent, you can decide if you want to join the chat as observer or participant depending on your permission level. Once you click the action from your toolbar, a new chat widget will be added to the list of your active chats which is the chat you have been invited to.

   If you join the chat as observer, you will only be able to read what others are contributing to the chat and you will be invisible to customer users or public users. Agents will still receive a message that you joined the chat as observer.

   As an observer, you have the possibility to become a participant anytime by using the advanced action toolbar in your chat widget depending on your permission level.

Participant
   If you want to contribute something to the chat you have been invited to, you can join it as a participant. Customer users, public users and agents will receive a message that you have entered the chat. As a participant, you can become an observer anytime by using the advanced action toolbar in your chat widget.

The second circle icon allows the agent to set up a personal monitoring for this chat, which is a three-way switch:

- Empty circle: no monitoring.
- Empty circle with tick icon: only monitor customer user activity.
- Filled circle with tick icon: monitor all actions.

When monitoring a chat, browser notifications will show up each time there is a new action in this chat.

Finally the third close icon makes it possible to close the chat by clicking on the *X*.


Chat Integration
----------------

The public chat can be easily integrated into a website with the chat integration configuration and snippet generator.

To configure the chat and generate code snippet:

1. Click on the *Configure Chat Integration* button in the left sidebar.
2. Customize the texts in the *Configuration* tab.

      Chat Integration – Configuration

   .. note::

      All changes made in the *Configuration* tab will not be saved. Every time you open this dialog, all fields will be reset to default values.

3. Copy the code snippet from the *Integration Code* tab and paste it into your website right before the ``</body>`` element.

   .. figure:: images/chat-integration-integration-code.png

4. You can check the result in the *Preview* tab.

   .. figure:: images/chat-integration-preview.png
      :alt: Chat Integration – Preview

      Chat Integration – Preview

   .. note::

      The preview uses the real chat module. Other agents have to be available for chatting to preview all features. 

If mixed content warning is displayed in the browser console, an administrator has to check that the system configuration setting ``HttpType`` is properly set. The website must run on the same protocol for chat widget to work.

For example, if the website is running OTRS on SSL, the system configuration option must be set to ``https``.
